Python Robotics Simulator 
===========================

This is a simple, portable robot simulator modified by me from the exercise given by [CarmineD8] (https://github.com/CarmineD8/python_simulator).

Installing and running
----------------------

The simulator requires a Python 2.7 installation, the [pygame](http://pygame.org/) library, [PyPyBox2D](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypybox2d/2.1-r331), and [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/).

Once the dependencies are installed, simply run the `test.py` script to test out the simulator.

## The Arena
-----------------------------

To run one or more scripts in the simulator, use `run.py`, passing it the file names.
The robot had to drive across the whole arena, in which the golden token reperesented an obstacol to avoid and the silver token the target to move. [Arena image ](Arena.jpg)
